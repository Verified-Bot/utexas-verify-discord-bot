Hi {{name}},

We received a request to verify your UT EID on Discord. If this wasn't you,
please email support@verifiedbot.com.

You should know:

1. Verified Bot is student-run, and is not an official service of UT or Discord.
2. Verifying your UT EID permanently associates your Discord account with your UT EID,
   and applies to every server.
3. We will share your affiliation, department and major with servers you are a part of,
   and may update this based on public directory information, until you ask us to stop.
4. We will not share your EID with anyone, unless we are obligated to do so by law, or
   upon request of a UT official.
5. We will not store any other information about you.
